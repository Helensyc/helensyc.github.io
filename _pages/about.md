I am pursuing my doctoral studies (25Fall) in the School of Humanities and Social Science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. I hold a bachelor’s degree in Urban and Rural Planning from the School of Geography and Planning at Sun Yat-sen University, and a master’s degree in Applied Geographic Information Systems from the National University of Singapore.

My past academic journey has widely spanned urbanization, human geography, public health, GIS, remote sensing, and spatial statistics, cultivating a strong spatial perspective and a growing enthusiasm for applying computational methods to address social challenges. Currently, my research interests focus on Bayesian statistics, spatial analysis & modelling, and public health.

Outside of research, I enjoy exploring astrology, running and yoga, keeping a regular diary, and listening to C-pop. I value the interplay between analytical thinking and creative curiosity, which continuously inspires both my academic and personal life.
