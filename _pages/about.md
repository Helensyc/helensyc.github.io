I am an incoming PhD student in Division of XXXXX at The Chinese University of HongKong, Shenzhen. Before that, I graduated from School of Geography and Planning, Sun Yat-sen University with bachelor's degree in Urban and Rural Planning and from Department of Geography, National University of Singapore with master degree in Applied Geographic Information Systems.

In the past years, I have been involved in a wide range of fields, from urbanization, human geography, public health, transportation, to GIS, remote sensing, spatial statistics, etc., thus also empowering me perspective of space. 

My current research interests mainly lie in Bayesian Statistics, Spatial Analysis and Public Health. Beyond academic interests, I have a passion and curiosity for astrology, and I am also a sports fan (especially for running and yoga), a regular dairy keeper, and a C-pop lover.
