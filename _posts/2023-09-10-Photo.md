People dressed in Hanfu walked through the ancient cities, especially in the temples. The red wall matches the color of the clothes and makeup, and it is a movie texture once you shoot it casually. The smoke curls up, the architecture of the temple gives a dignified and solemn appearance, and every little detail in the space tells of the old and the calm.
