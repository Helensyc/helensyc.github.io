      This project led by Professor Chao is about computing adult mortality rates in countries with high HIV prevalence using the Bayesian Hierarchical Model (BHM)☺~ This work aims to estimate the levels and trends in adult mortality for ages 15-59, i.e. the probability of dying between the ages of 15 and 59 years old by sex from 1950 to 2023.

  Estimating Adult Mortality Rates in 236 Countries Using Bayesian Hierarchical Models

Qiqi Qiang and I are involved in this project, and we employ High Performance Computing (HPC) resource of the university for this project due to the model’s complexity, as well as the diversity and large volume of data.😊

The work is summarized on the university’s website in the form of a case study. [Please click here to see the English version!](https://itso.cuhk.edu.cn/en/article/512) [Please click here to see the Chinese version!](https://itso.cuhk.edu.cn/article/512)

Here is the project's flowchart that we made!
