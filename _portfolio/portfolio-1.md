      This project led by Professor Chao is about computing adult mortality rates in countries with high HIV prevalence using the Bayesian Hierarchical Model (BHM)☺~ This work aims to estimate the levels and trends in adult mortality for ages 15-59, i.e. the probability of dying between the ages of 15 and 59 years old by sex from 1950 to 2023.
