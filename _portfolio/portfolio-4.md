title: "<span style='font-family: Georgia, serif; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.75rem;'>Urban Expansion Process in Guangzhou-Foshan Region</span>"
excerpt: |
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 1rem; margin-top:1.5rem;">
    <img src="/images/expansion1.png" style="width: 45%; display: block; margin: 0;" />
    <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 0.95rem; line-height: 1.4;">
      The project initially derived from my bachelor's thesis. What inspires me most is that math functions can be used to depict the different forms and characteristics of cities, informing the dynamic change of urban expansion. In the project, I also provide the source of inspiration and related application by link.
